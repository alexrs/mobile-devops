# mobile-devops
A curated list of resources for mobile devops, including blog posts and talks about tooling and infrastructure for mobile apps

## Why?
Mobile devops and Mobile tooling differs from the devops movement as some of the tools and practices are not applicable
to the way the mobile ecosystem works. This list contains useful resources for people interested in mobile tooling, mobile infrastructure and how to apply best practices to the mobile ecosystem from a devops point of view.
